# ⚡ Energy-Efficient GPU Architecture

This section collects papers focusing on **energy efficiency** and **scalable GPU architecture design**,  
including **cluster-level compute organization**, **dataflow reconfiguration**, and **microarchitectural power optimization**.

📘 *Notes:*  
I use this section to organize and reflect on works that redesign GPU compute structures or microarchitectural  
organization to achieve higher **performance per watt** and better **scalability**.  
These papers often trade off tight coupling (core-level units) for more flexible, cluster- or system-level designs.
